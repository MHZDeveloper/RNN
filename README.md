# RNN

In this repos, we present:
## Simple RNN

## LSTM

## GRU

## NLP
In this part, we will introduce a brief example in which we highlight the power of Natural Processing Language.

The one-shot RNN is a very simple encoder-decoder recurrent network model which encodes the content of an article and decodes the entire content of the summarized text.
In other words, we provide the system some words and find which title corresponds better to these words.


Here is a link of our presentation in which w introduce these concepts ()
