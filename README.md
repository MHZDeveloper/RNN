# RNN

In this repos, we present:
## Simple RNN

## LSTM

## GRU

This is an example of a birthrates timeseries prediction using Keras's implementation of  LSTMs and GRU RNN's , and we will be comparing both their performances .

requirements :

1)  pip install --upgrade pip
2) pip install keras h5py pandas sklearn
3) python evaluate.py

## NLP

In this part, we will introduce a brief example in which we highlight the power of Natural Processing Language.
The one-shot RNN is a very simple encoder-decoder recurrent network model which encodes the content of an article and decodes the entire content of the summarized text.
In other words, we provide the system some words and find which title corresponds better to these words.

requirements :

1)  pip install --upgrade pip
2) pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy
3) python one_hot_rnn_train.py
4) python one_hot_rnn_predict.py

Here is a link of our presentation in which w introduce these concepts (http://bit.ly/2E2ybkZ)

Enjoy !!!!
